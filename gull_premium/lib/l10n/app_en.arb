  "aboutStoryParagraph1": "Rehan Rose started from a simple belief: every bouquet should carry the care of a real florist and the freshness of flowers that were chosen and arranged by hand. We wanted to bring that experience to you—without the middleman, without the long supply chains.",
  "aboutStoryParagraph2": "That's why we work only with local florists. Each bouquet on Rehan Rose is made by a florist in your region—people who know the seasons, the flowers, and the craft. When you order from us, you're supporting small businesses and getting flowers that were prepared the same day, not shipped from far away.",
  "aboutStoryParagraph3": "Fresh flowers, local talent, and a platform that connects you to both—that's the story behind Rehan Rose. Thank you for being part of it.",
